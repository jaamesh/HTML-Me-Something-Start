               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">As a product manager with 15+ years of IT experience, I have led and delivered critical software development projects
                  for customer post-sales success and internal operational efficiency. I have a strong background in software architecture,
                  Java development, agile scrum, and API management, and a master's degree in electrical engineering.</p>
               <p>In my most recent role as Chief Product Manager at NI, I led a newly formed team that supported 70% of all web-site traffic,
                  100+ applications, and over 350 internal employees. I coordinated the architecture and design of new products with
                  cross-vertical teams and stakeholders, and managed an annual SW licensing budget of $1.2 million. One of my proudest
                     achievements was delivering a generative AI proof of concept chatbot for technical support engineers that saved them time
                     and improved customer solutions. I also established a quality management system that reduced support backlog from 75 issues
                     to 5 and improved feature completion from 10% to 80%. My mission is to delight the customer, improve profitability, 
                     build vision, drive decisions, and realize outcomes.</p>
